# <p align="center">Blockoverflow</p>
Blockoverflow is the project which allows you to stream tokens to the most deserving contributor among your platform users.
This project can allow peers to compete with each other to become eligible to get the stream of rewards.

The project will implement different types of usecases where other users will be able to create their own events and define rules on how to select the stream winner.

In very simple words, as long as the user maintains the winning position, it will continue to receive the token stream. Others should try to take that spot. It doesn't put a full-stop to your winning chance, instead gives you a chance to get a piece of the price.

## <p align="center">Usecase Implemented</p>
The current usecase is a simple Q & A implementation.

Example for use- A question poster will define a bounty and a timelimit.<br>
Peers can come and post as many answers as they want while upvoting the answer. 

Most upvoted answer will start to receive token streams from the bounty pool. The redirection of streams is handled by the Blockoverflow SuperApp Contract that is made.
